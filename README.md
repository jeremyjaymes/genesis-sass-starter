# Genesis Sass Starter

Version 0.5.0

## Summary
Originally based on the [Genesis Sample Theme](https://github.com/copyblogger/genesis-sample). Adapted to use Sass with Grunt.

This project is still very early in development. There are many todos and it still requires quite a bit of testing.  **As such I don't recommend using it directly, but, if you find it useful as a starting point fork away.**

## Planned Features
1. Mobile first
2. Better use of variables and defaults.
3. Calculations based on max-width variable?

*More to follow.*
